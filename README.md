### About
Like most dotfiles, the files in this repository include the configurations that make my system fit my needs.

You're free to clone my config but it is generally [frowned upon](https://www.anishathalye.com/2014/08/03/managing-your-dotfiles/#dotfiles-are-not-meant-to-be-forked) because dotfiles tend be something really personal. Rather, if you are interested in using my config, I suggest copying whatever you like and putting it in your own config.
That being said, suggestions are definitely open! This config will only work on Debian based systems. It will not run without Curl and a stable internet connection. Additional dependencies are installed if not found.
